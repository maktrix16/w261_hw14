## This contains code for HW14.3 and HW14.4
* the python notebook summarizes everything I have so far
* hw14-3 contains the scala code for running HW14.3. To use it you will need to open the directory and run sbt compile, sbt package, and then submit the jar file in the target directory to spark.
* hw14-4 contains the code for running FFM as part of HW14.4. The code is compiled and run the same way as above.
